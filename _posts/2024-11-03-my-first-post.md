# My First Post - Documenting setting up Github Pages as I set it up

This is only like my third try so that's great. 

So to create a github repo, you need to make a new repo and name it "(your github username).github.io". If you do anything other than your username, it will show all pages from then on out as (your github username).github.io/(repo name).github.io. Very annoying. I wish they were more clear about that. 

If you are new to all this, you can create an index.html with some stuff to make sure it is being served. But you are just testing GitHub's servers at that point. I like a good sanity test every now and again though.
